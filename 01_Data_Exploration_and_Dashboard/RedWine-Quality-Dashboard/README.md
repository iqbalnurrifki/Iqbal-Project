This interactive dashboard allows users to explore and visualize the **Red Wine Quality dataset** through intuitive and dynamic visualizations built in **RShiny**.

---

## 🧭 Overview
The project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the physicochemical factors that influence wine quality.  
It provides a set of interactive tools for visualizing variable distributions, correlations, and relationships between chemical properties and the final wine quality scores.

The dataset used is the **Red Wine Quality dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

### 🔹 1. Dataset Overview
- View dataset summary, number of observations, and variable descriptions.  
- Quick statistics of numerical features (mean, median, standard deviation).  

### 🔹 2. Variable Distribution
- Interactive **histograms** and **boxplots** for exploring distributions of chemical variables such as:
  - Fixed acidity  
  - Volatile acidity  
  - Citric acid  
  - Residual sugar  
  - Alcohol  
  - pH, sulphates, etc.  

### 🔹 3. Correlation Heatmap
- Dynamic correlation matrix between selected numerical features.  
- Visual representation of feature relationships with color gradients.  

### 🔹 4. Feature vs. Quality Visualization
- Compare how each chemical attribute influences wine quality score.  
- Interactive bar charts and scatter plots for selected variables.

### 🔹 5. About Tab
- Displays author profile, project background, and references.
